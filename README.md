# AIR Look Tracker

**AIR Look Tracker** is a project designed to help children stay focused during tasks. By monitoring attention through video analysis, the system detects when a child becomes distracted and provides real-time feedback.

## Features

- **Focus Monitoring**: Tracks the child's gaze and identifies distractions.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Issues a notification when the child loses focus.
- **Accountability**: Requires the child to complete 100 push-ups as a corrective action.
- **Mentor Verification**: Push-up completion is verified by a mentor before the notification is cleared.
- **Interactive Feedback Loop**: Encourages discipline and builds focus through an engaging system.

## How It Works

1. **Video Input**: A video of the child is analyzed to monitor gaze and attention.
2. **Distraction Detection**: If the child is distracted, the system sends a notification.
3. **Correction Task**: The child is prompted to complete 100 push-ups.
4. **Mentor Approval**: The child enters confirmation of task completion, and a mentor verifies it.
5. **Notification Clearance**: Once verified, the distraction notification is cleared.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For video processing and attention tracking.
- **Computer Vision**: Leveraging libraries like OpenCV for gaze tracking.
- **Backend**: To manage notifications and user input.
- **Frontend**: For the mentor verification interface.
